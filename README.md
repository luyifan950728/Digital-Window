# Digital-Window
This project involves real-time manipulation of live video feed with user head-tracking data to provide a viewing experience similar to that of looking out a window. While concepts related to head tracking to enhance viewer experience have been considered in the past, we seek a comprehensive approach with the added integration of live video and we used various implementation techniques to optimize this experience. For instance, we used general purpose GPU programming to correct for barrel distortion in a wide angle camera lens which improved our theoretical frame rate by over one hundred times. Whatâ€™s more, One-Euro filter algorithm is applied to eliminate noisy signals from the tracking system. Meanwhile, to maximize realism, a high definition network video camera and the second generation Microsoft Kinect are used
